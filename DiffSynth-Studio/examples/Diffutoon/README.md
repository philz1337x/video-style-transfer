# Diffutoon

[Diffutoon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16224) is a toon shading approach. This approach is adept for rendering high-resoluton videos with rapid motion.

## Example: Toon Shading (Diffutoon)

Directly render realistic videos in a flatten style. In this example, you can easily modify the parameters in the config dict. See [`diffutoon_toon_shading.py`](./diffutoon_toon_shading.py). We also provide [an example on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Artiprocher/DiffSynth-Studio/blob/main/examples/Diffutoon.ipynb).

## Example: Toon Shading with Editing Signals (Diffutoon)

This example supports video editing signals. See [`diffutoon_toon_shading_with_editing_signals.py`](./diffutoon_toon_shading_with_editing_signals.py). The editing feature is also supported in the [Colab example](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Artiprocher/DiffSynth-Studio/blob/main/examples/Diffutoon/Diffutoon.ipynb).

## Example: Toon Shading (in native Python code)

This example is provided for developers. If you don't want to use the config to manage parameters, you can see [`sd_toon_shading.py`](./sd_toon_shading.py) to learn how to use it in native Python code.
