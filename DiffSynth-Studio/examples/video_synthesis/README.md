# Text to Video

In DiffSynth Studio, we can use AnimateDiff and SVD to generate videos. However, these models usually generate terrible contents. We do not recommend users to use these models, until a more powerful video model emerges.

### Example 7: Text to Video

Generate a video using a Stable Diffusion model and an AnimateDiff model. We can break the limitation of number of frames! See [sd_text_to_video.py](./sd_text_to_video.py).
